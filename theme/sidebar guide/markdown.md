##### [ Special sidebar formatting guide (CSS related) ]

This subreddit uses some fancy CSS, which requires a specific sidebar structure.
Important element/content order:
- The flair filter selection has to be the first unordered list.
- The sticky box list has to be the first ordered list.

Sticky box formatting:
- Every list item should be a link to avoid unexcepted formatting issues.
- Every list item can have any string prepended as kind of a ~~`type description`~~.
- The syntax **`**String**`** styles any part of the link title in the color ~~`red`~~.
- The syntax **`_String_`** styles any part of the link title in the color ~~`white`~~.
